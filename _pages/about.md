Welcome! I'm Petros (Peter), a 3rd year Ph.D. student in Operations Research at MIT, advised by Prof. [Rahul Mazumder](https://www.mit.edu/~rahulmaz/). My interests lie at the intersection of mathematical optimization, high-dimensional statistics, machine learning, and differential privacy.  

I was previously a Senior Research Analyst in the Banking Studies department of the [NY Fed Research & Statistics Division](https://www.newyorkfed.org/research), working on numerous research and policy projects regarding bank reserves and their effect on monetary policy implementation. I received my B.S. degree in Applied Mathematics (with a concentration in Computer Science) and Economics from Yale, graduating with honors and distinction in both majors.  

Aside from problem solving, I also enjoy teaching, learning geography, doing calisthenics, swimming, biking, rowing, and listening to rap & contemporary classical music. I hold Greek and US dual citizenship.
